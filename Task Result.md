## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript 
- CSS
- HTML

I decided to use only Javascript, HTML and CSS, because I think that I don't need more for a pixel art generator.
I used Javascript for the functions like creating DIVs / pixels based on the selected grid size.
I used HTML for creating the webpage and the GRID.
I used CSS to design the webpage.

The whole project is not Responsive and made only for PC.
